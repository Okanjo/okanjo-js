# Okanjo-JS

Okanjo-JS is [Okanjo](http://okanjo.com)'s extensible widget framework that enables you to engage in native commerce by 
embedding customizable product listings or ads on a web page.

# Introduction

Okanjo’s Marketplace and Ad-Tech platforms transform content into commerce for publishers. These products enable 
publishers and advertisers to sell anywhere on the web. Okanjo’s contextual targeting technology delivers relevant 
shopping options to readers at the moment of interest and engagement. Then, transactions take place without ever 
leaving the publisher’s site. 

Okanjo-JS is the code used to embed this technology in a website or application. The JavaScript framework combines 
simplicity with flexibility to meet almost every imaginable use-case.
